        <h4><u>Topic Source Review</u></h4>
        <p class="mainContent">Starting my research, I knew that I wanted to do it with varied sources and so I investigated books and articles with differing perspectives and opinions. I started off my research by reading as many articles as I could find relevant to my topic of choice. I found an article<sup>1</sup> detailing the numerous risks that have already been documented with the use of AI. This was useful for my research as the information within it is relevant to the present day and addresses current issues stemming from the use of AI while also using real world examples. After looking at negative articles, I wanted to move on to looking at the positives of AI instead. I started looking at specific sectors of society where AI can be beneficial. I found two main useful articles: one detailing AI’s role in education<sup>2</sup>, the other in medicine<sup>3</sup>. Both articles discuss the many ways that AI could help in their respective fields backed by statistics and real-world examples of benefits, with the high level of detail and numerous references used in the articles making these into highly credible sources. To further differentiate my sources, I decided to read a book<sup>4</sup> by Martin Ford in which he interviews many people in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics. This source was particularly valuable as it provides insight into AI based on what people who actually work in that industry think. There are many first-hand accounts in the book, and it provides factual, unbiased perspectives on AI’s pros and cons. </p>
        <h4 class="multipleh4"><u>Website Source Review</u></h4>
        <p class="mainContent">In the process of deciding what format I wanted to use for my EPQ, I decided to go for one befitting my topic of choice: a website.  To learn how to make websites I used a website called Scrimba<sup>5</sup> which provided me with invaluable interactive courses that allowed me to learn how to make a website from scratch. For the design of the website, I took inspiration from many other websites<sup>6 7 8</sup>, mainly those that focused on interactivity, minimalism and user-friendly layouts. These gave me ideas of what I wanted to do with my website and how to give it a unique twist (for example by adding animations). A specific example of this was the Notion website<sup>9</sup> which motivated me to make my website more dynamic. Another very good source I found was the Awwwards website<sup>10</sup> which showcases some of the best websites on the internet. Some of these websites influenced the design choices I made for the website and the vision I had while coding it. I also gathered knowledge on user-friendly layout from an article by Vitaly Friedman<sup>11</sup> that taught me the importance of layout on the usability of a website with statistics and research also used to emphasise the importance of good design on the first impression of a user.</p>
