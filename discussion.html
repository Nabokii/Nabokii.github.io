        <h4>Discussion</h4>
        <p class="mainContent">Artificial intelligence (AI) has quite an extensive history, going back to the 1700s where the first concepts of AI were invented<sup>1</sup> and expanding to where it is today. However, there are many different controversies and opinions surrounding the topic of using AI in society as people try to settle the debate of whether all the upsides of using AI outweigh the negatives or whether we’d in fact be better off without it.</p>
        <p class="mainContent">Though a fairly new concept, we have already seen how AI can be used in the real world and how it brings benefits that were unheard of in the past. A big sector in society where we have already seen a big improvement due to the use of AI is education. AI has allowed education in developed countries to be of better quality by being used to detect when a student struggles with something and making sure to tackle this early in their education<sup>2</sup>, thus allowing students to be supported better and with help specifically tailored to them. AI also allows information to be widespread and helps in knowledge reaching more people, making the population as a whole more educated on various different topics, as we have already seen with tools such as ChatGPT. Other than just helping improve education that people already have, AI has also been used to provide education in poorer countries, to people who have limited access to it.  An AI-powered app called SuaCode was developed to provide lessons on programming and machine learning and is currently being used by people in 43 different African countries<sup>3</sup>. Moving on from schools, AI has also been used to help adults in poorer countries in their daily life, for example with an app called Ulangizi where farmers can ask the AI questions in Chichewa (their native language) and the app will respond back, also in Chichewa. Looking at all these benefits, it might be easy to forget that AI isn’t perfect, and some people argue that using AI in education can lead to negatives such as plagiarism, dishonesty and jeopardization of academic integrity<sup>4</sup>. While those are valid views and problems that we as a society will need to overcome, there’s no denying that the positives overwhelmingly outweigh the negatives and that with proper education and regulations on using AI, many of these issues will be mitigated while still reaping all the benefits. There also exists the major issue of misinformation being spread more easily due to AI, where algorithms on social media have been shown to recommend extreme content that is more likely to get a reaction out of a user without paying attention to the accuracy of the content<sup>5</sup>. However, with the correct training of AI on accurate and trustworthy datasets (which would also get rid of the issue of AI bias and discriminatory views) and with changes to the control of information flow on social media (such as by prioritising factual content) the spread of misinformation can be minimised as much as possible.</p>
        <p class="mainContent">Artificial intelligence has also been found to be irreplaceable in medicine and healthcare, where it has already been for a while. For example, in the year 2000, a robot called da Vinci was created to assist surgeons when performing complex surgeries and to do so with precision and accuracy. Since then, more than 775,000 patients around the world have had a da Vinci procedure<sup>6</sup>. There are also more general uses of AI in healthcare such as using AI to make more efficient systems for checking patients in, allowing more people to be seen by a doctor which will increase the number of people making a recovery. Faster, better research with the help of AI will also allow us to make more breakthroughs and get a clearer understanding of things we don’t know much about. Furthermore, AI’s efficiency and intelligence will lead to more accurate treatment and diagnosis since AI can remember more and use algorithms to identify patterns in millions of different health issues, allowing them to recognise even the most niche of problems. For example, there is an AI tool that can identify prostate cancer with 84% accuracy as opposed to the 67% accuracy of human doctors<sup>7</sup>, highlighting the efficacy of artificial intelligence in healthcare.</p>
        <p class="mainContent">The last main use of AI for the benefit of society is in crime prevention and safety of the public. A BBC article<sup>8</sup> discusses the different ways that AI has been used in preventing and solving crimes. The article goes into great lengths about uses ranging from Facebook using AI to unearth 9 million pictures of child nudity on their platform in only three months to police using a machine that finds evidence in photos of crime scenes. AI has already been proven to be able to identify crime and report it to stop it before it happens, for example in the case of human trafficking victims or by using facial recognition to be able to catch thieves<sup>9</sup>. However, many people would argue against using AI in law enforcement for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, AI is trained off data from humans and humans tend to be biased and can sometimes have discriminatory views (racism, sexism, homophobia) which can then be mirrored by the AI, leading to more cases of minorities being persecuted due to said bias. However, this can be diminished by training the AI with specially selected, neutral data with minimal bias. Another argument against AI in law enforcement is that many technologies used to prevent crime like various types of monitoring/tracking can cause privacy issues since it uses data on people without their explicit permission and, in extreme cases, can be used to incriminate people. This is a difficult issue to fix and there definitely doesn’t exist one definitive solution, however it could be made better by making sure people can give their educated consent (or lack thereof) or in public places where that isn’t possible, data protection systems should be established so that the data of people can’t be stolen or exploited. However, in the end, as we have already seen with some of the above examples, using AI to prevent crime provides our society with many different benefits so more people will be willing to accept technology such as facial recognition if they are educated on the advantages of using it.</p>
        <p class="mainContent">Overall, involving artificial intelligence in human society is a double-edged sword: AI definitely has proven to be a priceless addition in many different sectors of society, however the transition to using AI in a more mainstream context won’t be without challenge. Even so, with enough time and regulations on the use of AI recommended by experts<sup>10</sup>, artificial intelligence is sure to become a welcome and key addition in society to improve the quality of life for the average person.</p>
