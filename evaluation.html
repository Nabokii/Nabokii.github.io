        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
        <p class="mainContent">Working on this project has allowed me to improve upon many skills and expand on my knowledge of the topic of AI’s current impact on the world. While it was a challenge to find appropriate sources, my research has given me substantial knowledge on AI and has allowed me to enhance my abilities of identifying relevant sources and focusing only on the key information when overwhelmed with many different views and facts. However, I do wish that I could go back and do more extensive research, possibly even discussing more areas in society than the ones that I included. I also regret that I didn’t have as much time as I would’ve liked to work on the EPQ since for most of the time I spent on this project I also had 4 A-levels to focus on in the background. Overall though I believe that I managed to achieve my brief quite well by being able to educate on the different effects of AI.</p>
        <p class="mainContent">Making my project as an artefact, I had to learn how to work on both the content and the website simultaneously and how to allocate my time in such a way that both parts got the attention they needed. I stumbled upon many issues with my code that I had to work through and try to fix during the process of creating the website. The JavaScript side of my code (the part responsible for all the interactivity and timings of animations) especially led to many problems and it often seemed that for every line of JavaScript I wrote I’d have a new bug introduced into my code. This caused me a lot of frustration and time that I could’ve used on writing the content of my website that I had to use instead to fix the bugs. However, regardless of how time-consuming it was, usually I managed to get over the issue. Looking back, there were some ideas that I had that I regret not being able to implement since I just didn’t know how to. For example, I would’ve loved to add more animations and advanced interactivity to the website but that was above my skill level and the website already took around 15 hours total to make and polish so I had limited time to learn completely new mechanics of the programming languages that I was using. Though leaving the website as minimalist as possible allowed me to focus more on the content and functionality of it than the aesthetic so it wasn’t the end of the world. In the end, there are many things I’m glad I had to learn how to do when making the website: hosting it, adding animations, adding images when writing the website locally (on my laptop as opposed to online, which is what I usually do). All the skills the EPQ gave me will hopefully come very useful in my hobbies and future ambitions and I’m very happy that I had the opportunity to do this.</p>
